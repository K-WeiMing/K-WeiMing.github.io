My name is Wei Ming. This page is to document what I've learnt since I started my journey into Python since 2020 and to share some of the work that I've completed that may be useful to readers.

<!-- ### My story -->

<!-- To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
## Short Description About Me
Currently working at AI Singapore (AISG) under the Natural Language Department (NLP Hub), working on exploring repositories for low-resource languages and incorporating them into AISG's products for SeaCoreNLP and SG-NLP.

In my previous life I was working in the Pharmaceutical Sector, through the use of Python and VBA I'm trying to find different ways to digitalise and automate existing work processes to be more efficient and eliminate human error.
